##    what is Generative ai(Gen AI)

* gen ai refers to a class of a ai systems that learns patterns from large amount of data and generate new content such as text,images,code audieo or video.

**EX**
1. Text-chatgpt,gemini for emails
2. image-adobe firefly,nano banana
3. code-cursor ai,co-polit,anti gravity
4. video-heygen,openai
5. Audio-elevenlabs,suno,soundraw

 ## How genarative ai works
 gen ai technology that creates a new content 

## it has two phases
* learning phase
* creating phase

## what is LLM?


### types of LLM
1. Base LLM(Foundation model)
    * it is pre-trained model in ai 
    * to predict the next word in a sequence

2. instruction Tuned LLM

# Day-2
## why prompt engineering?
* output genrated by genai closely resembles of humans
* it is a relevant ,contexual,imaginative,lingustically accurate
* one of the critical factors in generating such as output is prompt

## what is prompt?
* Any input to provide to a generative ai model to deaiered output
* you can think of it as an instruction that you provide the model
 ### Anotomy (structure) of perfect prompt?
  **the five Elements of a prompt**
  * **Persona**-Role of the AI
  * **Context**-What the background?
  * **Task**-What exactly do you whant?
  * **contraints**-What should it aviod?
  * **OutputFormat**-How do you Want the answer?

  ### prompting task
  to give prompt to cheif in restarent ai will asking you what u want?
  ### types of prompting
  1. few-short prompt
  2. chain of thoughts prompt
  3. meta promt
  4. SYSTEM PROMPTING
  5. user prompting

  ### few-short prompting task
  * tweet-  i love movie
  * sentiment-postive
  ### chain of thoughts?
  1. a technique to enable the LLM to think step by step.
 ### meta prompting(using ai to write prompts)
 we asking a ai to prompt it take and giving to another ai to gnerate o/p.

### system prompt vs user prompt
